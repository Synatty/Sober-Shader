# How to use

Put the SoberShader.lua file into the roblox workspace or anything else it should work if it doesn't open the console and send what is says in Issues or in dsc.gg/lumixteam <-- My discord

in my discord you can create a ticket after you verify it will be much quicker than sending it in Issues
